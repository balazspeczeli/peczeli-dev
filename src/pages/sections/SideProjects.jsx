    <p>
      I'm writing{" "}
      <a
        href="https://github.com/balazsdavid987/algoritmusok-hu"
        target="_blank"
      >
        an interactive book
      </a>{" "}
      in Hungarian on algorithms and data structures. Although dozens of
      similiar books have been already written, I believe my project will help
      fellow developers to level up in a much more fun way than it is possible
      with traditional books.

      My other active side project is a{" "}
      <a
        href="https://github.com/balazsdavid987/music-catalogue-app"
        target="_blank"
      >
        music catalogue
      </a>
      . It's a simple CRUD app with an Angular frontend and a GraphQL API. There
      are two deployments so far:{" "}
      <a href="https://.../" target="_blank">
        Bachata Music Catalogue
      </a>{" "}
      and{" "}
      <a href="https://.../" target="_blank">
        Salsa Music Catalogue
      </a>
    </p>

      In the past I used to do a bit more <em>sexy</em> side projects in a l’art
      pour l’art fashion, like{" "}
      <a href="https://github.com/balazsdavid987/Pottery-Wheel" target="_blank">
        a pottery wheel simulation
      </a>
      ,{" "}
      <a
        href="https://github.com/balazsdavid987/Sliding-Puzzle-Factory"
        target="_blank"
      >
        an app that lets you create your own sliding puzzles
      </a>
      ,{" "}
      <a
        href="https://github.com/balazsdavid987/Freeze-by-KyleDineen"
        target="_blank"
      >
        a music visualizer
      </a>
      , or{" "}
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGgNdQPb8bI" target="_blank">
        a video game
      </a>{" "}
      (note: this links to a video with loud music!) .
