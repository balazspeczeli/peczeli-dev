      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I was born in 1987 in <Icon src="icons/flags/hu.png" />
        Hungary, a small country in Central Europe. Like many in my generation,
        I have started my journey into computer programming by making websites
        and simple video games during high school. Although I did a Liberal Arts
        degree at the University of Debrecen (Debrecen is Hungary's
        second-largest city), software development became my profession.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site was created to share my personal interests and hobby projects.
        My stack is mainly made up of web technologies (the triad of
        HTML-CSS-JavaScript), but in recent years I also got acquainted with
        Java, Python, and DevOps tools. For details on my experience and work
        history, please visit my <Icon src="icons/github.svg" />

        When not sitting in front of a computer, I enjoy cooking, hiking, and
        spending time with my family.
