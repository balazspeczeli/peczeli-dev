This is one of the best documentary series I have ever seen.

The show explains why design is not just applied art but how it defines the way we feel about and interact with the world. It showed me not to think of product vs. experience: the product itself is the experience, the product creates its own world. Moreover, design is actually problem solving: good design is not only about aesthetics but it solves problems, and bad design is not just a lack of beauty but it also creates problems.

Eight episodes present the lives of eight very different personalities: how they think and approach creative work. None of them seems to be driven by their ego but by their passion for their craft: they don’t want to show the world what _their design_ is but what _good design_ is.

Although this show has nothing to do with programming, we can find some commonalities with what the kind of activities presented and software design. The outcome is a set of constraints that create a system which in turn solves a practical problem.

Below are some of the ideas from the series that I found particularly interesting.

## Christoph Niemann (Illustration)

> “It’s not about waiting for hours for this moment where inspiration strikes. It’s just about showing up and getting started and then something amazing happens or it doesn’t happen. All that matters is you enable the chance for something to happen.”

> “Relax; don’t be so hard on yourself. I actually totally disagree. You have to practice and become better. Every athlete, every musician practices every day. Why should it be different for artists?”

> “The idea of pop music is not to invent a new story, but to tell the same story again in a new and interesting way.”

> “My goal is to speak visuals…like a pianist speaks piano. And like somebody controls the keys and can convey different ideas, different emotions, through that language.”

## Tinker Hatfield (Footwear design)

> “I think there’s art involved in design. But to me, I don’t think of it as art. My perception of art is that it’s really the ultimate self-expression from a creative individual. For me as a designer, it is not the ultimate goal to become self-expressive. The end goal is to solve a problem for someone else, and hopefully it looks great to someone else and it’s cool to someone else.”

> “People struggle with stuff they don’t understand, design that’s different than what they’re used to. Yet what creates excitement and gets people to pay attention, is to kind of force the disruptive nature of like, “Whoa, that’s a big idea.”

> “A basic design is always functional, but a great one will say something.”

> “If people don’t either love or hate your work, you just haven’t done all that much.”

## Es Devlin (Stage design)

> “A lot of my work now is about finding environments for music.”

> “They have all come to focus their gaze on one person. We don’t need to say worship, but all the energy of the room is focused on that one little individual, and that in itself is an extraordinary, physiological event.”

> “The word “show” suggests that you’re revealing something. It doesn’t suggest finding.”

> “Theater makers are aware of the ephemerality of what they’re making. Nothing’s going to last. You know when you set out to make it that it’s going to be gone. Sometimes in a week, sometimes in four days, sometimes in four years. In the end, everything is only going to exist in the memories of people. You had to be there on that night, to see that performance from Benedict Cumberbatch, or from Beyoncé.”

## Bjarke Ingels (Architecture)

> “When architecture is at its best, […] you’re coming up with something that is pure fiction. Then after all the hard work, all the permits, all the budgeting and all the construction, it now becomes concrete reality.”

> “There’s no doubt that in architecture there’s this catch-22. Nobody will entrust you to build a building until you’ve already built a building.”

> “Whenever we talk about architecture, and whenever people have opinions about architecture, the most typical argument is: something is bad because it doesn’t fit in.”

> “When you’re doing something like this, even though it’s carefully crafted, and premeditated and discussed and designed and tested, when you see it, it has to feel effortless.”

## Ralph Gilles (Automotive design)

<img src="/images/posts/abstract-the-art-of-design/5-ralph-gilles-automotive-design.jpg" class="centered" />

> “Most designs have a theme line that holds the design together. […] If you don’t get the bones right, you’re never gonna have a good design, no matter how hard you try.”

> “I remember in school, times we talked about, “Can you sketch this car in three lines?” You know? “Is it distinctive enough to capture it?”

> “It transcends much more than what we do as designers. It becomes popular culture. And I think that’s pretty cool.”

> “I believe what we do as designers is create taste. Sometimes we’re a little bit ahead of culture, or ahead of the times and we challenge it.”

> “Doing a new vehicle from scratch is about a billion-dollar investment. So you’ve got to know what consumers are going to want even before consumers know what they want.”

## Paula Scher (Graphic design)

> “You can create an identity for a whole place based on a recognizability of type.”

> “If a font is heavy and bold, it may give you a feeling of immediacy. If a font is thin and has a serif form, it may feel classical. So that, before you even read it, you have sensibility and spirit.”

> “Ideas come all kinds of ways. I get my best ideas in taxicabs, you know, like sitting in traffic, drooling. I’m allowing my subconscious to take over, so that I can free associate. You have to be in a state of play to design. If you’re not in a state of play, you can’t make anything.”

> “I’m driven by the hope that I haven’t made my best work yet. Making stuff is the heart of everything. That drive never goes away. What can I make next?”

## Platon (Photography)

<img src="/images/posts/abstract-the-art-of-design/7-platon-photography.jpg" class="centered" />

> “I’m not really a photographer at all. The camera is nothing more than a tool. Communication, simplicity, shapes on a page. What’s important is the story, the message, the feeling.”

> “Design, for me, was a way out of confusion. Because great design simplifies a very complicated world.”

> “I don’t believe you should ever allow your tools to dominate the message. Great design is when all those things take a backseat and you get the message.”

> “I got jumped by this guy. And he beat the living daylights out of me. Skull fractured, both cheek bones, eye sockets, all my ribs busted. […] It was just like, “Why me?” Mumbling through my messed-up mouth. And this old lady in the bed next door said, “Young man, why not you? What’s so special about you?”

## Ilse Crawford (Interior design)

<img src="/images/posts/abstract-the-art-of-design/8-ilse-crawford-interior-design.jpg" class="centered" />

> “Some people think interior design is a look. In fact, “It must be really fun buying furniture” is something one person said to me once. But I see it differently. We spend 87% of our lives inside buildings. How they are designed really affects how we feel, how we behave. Design is not just a visual thing.”

> “One of the qualities that distinguishes her work from that of other interior designers is that it’s about how we experience a room and how we ourselves feel in a room to satisfy the subconscious. Ilse’s strength is her humanity and her caring. She really cares about wellbeing.”

> “I wanted to get my hands dirty and really do something for myself. I’m driven by my curiosities. By learning more about what made people comfortable in space, researching in anthropology, behavioral science and so on, that really made me understand how we discover the world.”

> “We actually understand materials best by contrast. Our senses are wired in such a way that we understand that rough feels rougher by contrast with smooth. To get the best out of these materials, we needed to find its opposite.”
> “Design that encourages people to be close together is a good thing.”
