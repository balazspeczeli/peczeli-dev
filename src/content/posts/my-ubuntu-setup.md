I have been using Ubuntu as my primary OS for personal computing since 2015. My then notebook was a bit old and I had performance issues with Windows, so I have decided to give Ubuntu a try and stuck with it.

My current notebook is a Dell Inspiron 5570 and I don't remember experiencing any issues that could not be solved with a little bit of Googling.

From time to time, I run a Windows in VirtualBox when there is some very specific app I need to use, like for example PhotoShop, but otherwise I am more than satisfied with Ubuntu.

Here's a list of the software I use. I believe my set of tools is pretty average, so feel free to suggest me your favorite cool app!

## Essentials

### Terminal

I use the built-in one.

### Gnome Tweak Tool

A powerful tool to customize the GNOME shell. The only extension I use is called Dash to panel which gives me a Windows-style taskbar.

### Open Graphics Drivers

An absolute must. I have zero problems with my displays since I have found this package.

## Office apps

### Browser

Most of the time I use Google Chrome, sometimes Mozilla Firefox.

### E-mail client, word processing, spreadsheets

I use Gmail, Google Docs and Google Sheets for these tasks.

### Document viewer

<a href="https://okular.kde.org/" target="_blank">Okular</a> is perfect for PDF and ePub documents. I use its highlighter feature extensively.

Update (2021): <a href="https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/adobe_acrobat_%E2%80%93_pdf_and_esignature_tools/80763634447" target="_blank">Adobe Acrobat for Google Drive</a> is also a decent choice for reading PDF documents. The files are stored on Google Drive and modifications (e.g. highlights) are saved automatically.

## Development

### Code editor, IDE

VS Code works fine for me. Sometimes I open IntelliJ IDEA for Java development but often it's just too heavy for my personal projects.

### Git client

Although I have tried GitKraken and others, I mostly use the one built in VS Code.

### Firefox Developer Edition

It has some nice tools but I don't actually use it as part of my development workflow.

## Multimedia

### VLC media player

Plays almost all kinds of formats and very fast. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.videolan.vlc&hl=en" target="_blank">VLC for Android</a> is also pretty good.

### Audacity

Lightweight and easy to use. Perfect for editing audio files, might not be the best for complex workflows.

### imagemagick

A command line tool for manipulating images. It has many features, I mostly use it for resizing, cropping, and compressing images combined with BASH scripts.

### Screenshot tool

I use <a href="https://shutter-project.org/" target="_blank">Shutter</a> for creating screenshots. <a href="https://flameshot.org/" target="_blank">Flameshot</a> also looks nice but haven't tried it yet.

### youtube-dl

I use youtube-dl for downloading videos from YouTube so I can watch them later offline and for converting music videos into mp3 files. It can also download videos from Facebook and <a href="https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html" target="_blank">many other platforms</a>.

## Other tools

### FSlint

A small utility that finds duplicate files.

### Disk Usage Analyzer

Scans directories and displays a nice visualization on how much disk space is consumed by each subdirectory.

## Gaming

Although Ubuntu might never be able to run all the games that Windows can, it can run a surprisingly large number of games from the 2000s and 2010s era.

### C&C: Red Alert 2

A classic real-time strategy game. The player controls infantry, tanks, planes, and ships and can even launch nuclear missiles.

The game is more than 20 years old but still there's an active community around it.

### Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive

A game in which the player controls six characters in a wild west setting. I really enjoyed the cinematics and the voice acting in it.

### ZSNES

An emulator for Super Nintendo games. Growing up I did not have a SNES console so I was very happy when I found out that there is a way to play Super Maria, Castlevania and other great SNES games on a PC.

Completing the games are much easier because you can save the game state at any point and then continue from there when you die.
