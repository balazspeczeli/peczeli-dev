I rarely watch TV, but caught the trailer of a show while my brother was watching the National Geographic Channel and decided to binge watch all 14 episodes of it (each is about 20 minutes long).

_Science of Stupid_ showcases accidents and provides short, but insightful scientific explanations on why did they happen. The Hungarian title is "_Pedig jó ötletnek tűnt..._", which translates to "_But it seemed to be a good idea..._". In Germany, it was aired with a title "_"Wissenschaft der Missgeschicke_" which translates to "_Science of the unlucky_". I like both of these titles more than the original because the word stupid sounds a bit derogatory for people suffering accidents while trying to push their limits (or just simply having fun), but it is also true that some of the acts presented does show a complete lack of common sense.

Anyways, my favorite quotes from the show:

> “Try to break the laws of science and they will break you.”

> “Ignoring physics is a recipe for disaster.”

> “If you ignore the laws of nature, they will pay you back.”

> “Don't just rely on blind luck, trust in science.”

> “Mess with science and it will mess you up.”

It's a really-really great show, an absolute must for any nerd!

**Update**: there is even a second season with 15 additional episodes!
