The title translates to "_The Revolution of Thinking - How does mathematics shape the world?_" and this book is only available in Hungarian.

A short and entertaining guide on the development and application of mathematics throughout the history of mankind. The author starts with how the concept of numbers has emerged, touches a bit of probability theory, formal logic, economics, and finishes with information theory, computer science and the history of Silicon Valley. Probably you won't have any great revelations while reading this book but it's a good companion for rainy weekends.
