This is a fun little book with easy to understand explanations and cool projects that elegantly mix Python and mathematics. The complexity of the topics discussed gradually increases: the author starts with the very basics of programming (variables, loops, conditionals), transitions into mathematics (algebra, geometry, complex numbers, matrices), and finishes with computer science (recursion, cellular automata, genetic algorithms).

Most of the projects involve some kind of visualization with Processing and it took me some time to get the hang of the coding style it requires.

It's a nice book to broaden your horizons and I can wholeheartedly recommend reading it even if you have never worked with Python.
