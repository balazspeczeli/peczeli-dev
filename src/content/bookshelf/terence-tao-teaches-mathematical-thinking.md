_This is not a book but a series of video lessons._

Terence Tao is undoubtedly one of the top mathematicians in the world and yet this one and a half hour long talk contains almost no equations or formal proofs. Although he shares many personal anecdotes, he remains in the background and shows how matemathical thinking at the fundemental level is not that different from everyday ordinary thinking.

I have found it quite inspirational when he says that it is completely normal to feel frustrated and sometimes even he has impostor syndrome. Of course, he thinks on a completely different level compared to me but it's reassuring the hear that math is hard from someone who has started to learn calculus at the age of seven!
