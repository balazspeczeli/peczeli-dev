In spite of its title, this book has almost no code in it and is not for beginner developers.

The author defines a set of laws and rules for effective software design. Some of them may sound trivial, like "Be consistent." or "You can't predict the future.", yet we tend to forget them and end up with bloated and overengineered systems.

The book can be downloaded for free from the [author's website](https://www.codesimplicity.com/book/). It's a short one (80 pages) and well worth the read.
