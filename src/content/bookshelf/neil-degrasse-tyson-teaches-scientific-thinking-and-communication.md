_This is not a book but a series of video lessons._

Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of the most well-known science communicators in the Western world. His style is very unique and presents complex topics in an entertaining way.

He briefly explains the scientific method and what objective truth is, touches upon the value of being a skeptic, the dangers of cognitive biases, and illustrates how scientific measurement works with everyday examples. The latter part (about 1/3 of the whole) is about his approach to communication and although its valuable I would have preferred to hear more _sciency stuff_. Anyway, here's my favorite quote from him:

> As the area of our knowledge grows, so too does the perimeter of our ignorance.
